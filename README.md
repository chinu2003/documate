### Using Open Source Language Models

DocuMate is a smart PDF query platform designed to help users upload PDFs and extract valuable insights by asking natural language questions. It supports extracting text, tables, and images from PDFs, using open-source language models to generate accurate answers. This makes document interaction efficient, user-friendly, and accessible.

## Features
- **PDF Upload:** Upload your PDFs and extract information from text, tables, and images.
